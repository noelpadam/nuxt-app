[build]
  # ✅ Simplification: The "bun --bun run" is generally only needed for
  # the 'dev' command. For 'build', simply running 'bun run nuxt build' 
  # is sufficient when NETLIFY_USE_BUN is true.
  command = "bun install && bun --bun run nuxt build"
  
  # default Nuxt 3/4 Nitro output, as 'dist' is often incorrect.
  publish = "dist" 

# Configuration for the serverless function handler
[functions]
  # ✅ Correct: This targets the directory where the Nuxt Netlify adapter 
  # places the final serverless function handler.
  directory = ".netlify/functions-internal"
  # Removed: node_bundler = "esbuild" - Not usually needed with Nuxt/Nitro preset.
